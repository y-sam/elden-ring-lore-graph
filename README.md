# Elden Ring Lore Graph

A Neo4j-powered knowledge graph modeling the characters, places, events,
artifacts, and metaphysical concepts of the Elden Ring universe.

## Project Phases
1. Graph modeling and data ingestion
2. Query API and natural-language interface
3. Visualization and analysis

## Core Principles
- Lore is represented as a graph, not tables
- Relationships carry meaning
- Ambiguity is explicit and preserved
- Every assertion has a source

## Status
Phase 1 — Schema design
